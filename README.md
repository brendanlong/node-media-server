A basic Node.js media server

This programs serves the audio, video and images in a directory in a barebones
keyboard-accessible media interface.

This was created as an example for a media server discovery project but may
be useful for people wanting to access media on a TV conveniently.

To run:

```
yarn install
node index.js -d your-media-folder
```
